Core War (or Core Wars) is a programming game in which two or more battle programs 
(called "warriors") compete for the control of the "Memory Array Redcode Simulator" 
virtual computer ("MARS"). These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly 
language called Redcode. The object of the game is to cause all processes of the opposing 
program(s) to terminate, leaving your program in sole possession of the machine.


This project was made for an university project.

The project is only available on Linux plateforms because it use X Server.

TO START PROGRAMS, you always have to stay in / directory.


To start CoreWar virtual machine :

./src/cw 



CoreWar fighter are in /cw directory.
So to start a tournament with all fighter, use this command :

./src/cw cw/*.cwb


You can also use the CoreWar assembler and the CoreWar desassembler :

./src/cwassembler
./src/cwdesassembler





Enjoy!
